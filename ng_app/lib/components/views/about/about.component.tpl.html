<h1>About</h1>
<h2>What's the point of structures.fyi?</h2>
<p>This website was made with two uses in mind:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Giving biochemists an interactive, immersive, and easy to use platform for presenting structural information</li>
	<li>Giving laypeople a peak into the fun and interesting world of structural biology</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who made structures.fyi?</h2>
<p>Structures.fyi is a personal project of <a href='http://www.its.caltech.edu/~tstevens/index.html'>Taylor Stevens</a>, who is a PhD student in Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics at Caltech.</p>
<h2>Are there bigger plans down the road?</h2>
<p>The current version of the website was made to test the water for interest in a more complete application. I have a number of ideas for features that could make this website more useful, and I am hoping that I receive a lot of input on the <a href='/feedback'>feedback</a> page to get a better idea of what people might want out of structures.fyi. Some ideas that I have:</p>
<ul>
	<li>More flexibility control and edit the input structure (i.e. uploading custom .pdb files, combining multiple files, translating individual protein chains).</li>
	<li>Add user accounts and give users the option to create non-public structure presentations.</li>
	<li>Add voting features to allow users to vote on a 'Structure of the Month' or something like that.</li>
	<li>Provide presentations in an embedable format so that labs, journals, and anyone else can add presentations to their own webpages.</li>
	<li>Add features that facilitate sharing presentations through social media.</li>
</ul>
